# General presentation

Altivar Machine ATV340, a variable speed drive designed for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), is apt to design machine with optimal performances, to fulfill advanced application requirements for 3 Phase synchronous and asynchronous motors from 0.75 to 75 kW (1 to 100 Hp).

## Improved machine performance

### Enhanced control of various kinds of motors
  - Increased speed bandwidth
  - Maximum torque availability
  - Reduced application cycle time

### Standard Ethernet connectivity 
  - Minimum automation cycle time for faster execution
  - Access to all relevant machine data for a perfect machine optimization
  - Real-time asset monitoring to maintain an optimal machine effectiveness

### Maximum distributed control performance
  - Positioning as Embedded machine function

## Extended machine availability

### Robustness 
  - Harsh environment conditions 
  - Operation until 60ºC with de-rating, up to 50ºC without de-rating
  - Compliant with machine-related safety standards EN ISO 13849-1 and EN-62061

## Reduced total machine cost

### Optimize electrical cabinet
  - Book format with high power density
  - Side by side mounting

### Neat and compact 
  - Reduce the need of additional devices with Embedded encoder and Embedded STO
  - Reduce installation time thanks to spring type terminals, EMC kit, and Pluggable motor connector
  - Reduce configuration time by:
    - Easy address mapping using Ethernet
    - Transfer full configuration from PLC to application including drive parameters using SoMachine
    - TVDA integration and complete set of function block in SoMachine 
    - PLCopen Compliant
    - Save commissioning time with one button auto-tuning for motor identification

### Simple customized control
  - Use your standard configuration even when prescribed
  - With multiprotocol Ethernet, no need to change your  drive configuration to  connect another network
